*** "home purchase value" variable: created, later deleted
  Deleted in commit 5967f198000676bd0107065bb332a4dc9aa9192b
  It was never used.
  It was being computed from the COICOP code for a home purchase,
    but that code never appears in the database.
    Evidence:
      >>> (purchases["coicop"] == "12610104").mean()
      0.0
** unknowable
*** No way to know when someone was interviewed
because anonymized
(per Camilo Andres Avila Carreño at DANE)
*** person-level expenditure data is unavailable
The goal of the purchase data is household, not person, expenditures.
(per Camilo Andres Avila Carreño at DANE)
** undescribed variables
(per Camilo Andres Avila Carreño at DANE)
*** directorio
The only key variable.
*** orden
Identifies people in people data.
In others, it's not, and it's useless.
*** secuencia_encuesta
also useless
*** secuencia_p
also useless
*** cap
= capitulo = section of the survey
Has to do with `mensualizacion`.
They follow urban 2 weeks, rural 1 week.
** non-encoded defaults
*** if a purchase is not labeled, call it a purchase.
 (per Camilo Andres Avila Carreño at DANE)
 (tax.co already does this.)
** errors
*** there are bad outliers
  Camilo Andres Avila Carreño at DANE says yeah, such problems exist, use your judgment.
**** absurdly big purchase numbers
  absurdly_big_expenditure_threshold = 1e9 # MAGIC
  Something in the full sample has a quantity value of 9e7.
  Currently I don't throw out any quantities, just expenditures.
*** households with no income but positive spending
 (per Camilo Andres Avila Carreño at DANE)
 They might have been temporarily unemployed.
 In the GEIH they impute income from (space,edu)-neighbors for people reporting no income.
** One does not need quantity to determine expenditure.
says Camilo Andres Avila Carreño
** P7516, "used savings" 
*** P7516, "used savings" is long-term only
says Camilo Andres Avila Carreño
*** P7516, "used savings" varies within household
** "home purchase value" is, if present, not encoded via COICOP
>>> (purchases["coicop"] == "12610104").mean()

****** P8612S2 : income, year : grant : edu, non-beca, in-kind
***** P6500-P6640S1 : asalariados
****** clarifications
   Not contractors, not business owners. The basis for all the "overlook" questions is p6500 (labor income). The survey includes in-kind payments.
   DIAN counts in-kind payments as income for tax purposes, so we'd better.
   "Subsidio" in this context can mean something given by the employer, not nec'y the gov't.
   No in-kind payments are included in P6500, so there are no "did you include this in that" questions for in-kind payments.
****** monthly variables
******* P6500 = income, month : labor : formal employment
as an "asalariado" last month
******* P6510S1 = income, month : labor : overtime
******* P6510S2 = income, month : labor : overtime, included in 6500
Other question pairs are similar: "Overtime pay" and "Did you include overtime pay in your asalariado (next) report?" If not, must add.
******* P6590S1 = income, month : labor : food, in-kind
******* P6600S1 = income, month : labor : lodging, in-kind
******* P6610S1 = income, month : labor : transport, in-kind

******* P6630S6A1 = income, year : labor : work accident payments
***** SKIP hours last week
***** P6765-P1651S1 : independientes
****** definition
independientes = self-employed, temporary workers, contractors. That classification as "independientes" is obtained from answers to question P6430-options 4 and 5. Option g for P6765 implies the filling of an extra form (“modulo de negocios”: info is relevant for small businesses in activities related to commerce, industry, and services).
****** P6750 = income, month : labor : independent
****** P6760 = income, month : labor : independent, months
divide P6750 by this to get monthly
the definition of P6750 contradicts the definition of this a little bit, but David says the treatment in place is correct.
******                 P550 = income, year : labor : rural
****** TODO david : P6779S1 : income, month : labor : viaticum ?2
Is P6750 already increased by P6779S1, or should we add it?
If it's included, that's weird, because it's monthly
***** for *both* asalariados and independents
****** UNUSED : P6790 - ... = time spent working
****** UNUSED : P6880 : where they work (door to door, driving, farm, factory, ...)
****** TODO contribution variables : ambiguous in two senses
******* The salary inclusion ambiguity
 For each of these 4 cases:
    Asalariado & paying all of it
    Asalariado & paying some, the employer the rest
    Independent & paying nothing
    Independent & paying all of it
 suppose the employer spends 10 on the employee, and 1 goes to pensions. What will questions P6920S1 and the main income question (P6500 or P6750) say? Same for P6990S1, P9450S1
******* The period ambiguity : are these all monthly amounts?
******* pension contribs
******** P6920 = contributing to a pension fund
******** TODO P6920S1 = pension contributions (no unit of time given!)
******** TODO P6940 = who pays the pension contributions
  option C is illegal
******* UNUSED : P6990* : work injury insurance
******* UNUSED : P9450* : caja de compensacion
***** P7040 - ... = second job
****** P7070 = income, month : labor : job 2

****** P9460S1 : income, month : benefit : unemployment
****** P7422S1 : income, month : labor : as unemployed
***** P7472 - ... : "inactive"

** where-got
*** CORRECTION : Ignore the parts below that say "no vat".
Even a tiny bodega has incentive to charge VAT (unless they add more than half the product's value), to be reimbursed. A callejero is probably not getting reimbursed, but the value they add is very small, and the VAT from the rest of the production chain will still reach the consumer.
*** use the value on the right
*** relevant only for food
*** not present in these files; can assume bought in a place that charges VAT
**** medios. can ignore -- this file is only useful to us for purchasess of extremely expensive (> $ 880 m) second homes
