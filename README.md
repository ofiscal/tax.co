# Introduction

tax.co is a model of the Colombian tax system.

There are README documents scattered throughout this filetree.
For instance, the [README file in the python/ folder](python/README.md)
is helpful for understanding the Python code.

To get started using the code, please see
[how to run tax.co](markdown/How-to-run-tax.co.md).
The [markdown/](markdown/) folder has more potentially helpful documentation.


# For the truly adventurous, some documentation is in other repos

The Observatorio Fiscal org-roam repo:
```
https://github.com/ofiscal/knowledge-graph
```
is a knowledge graph --
a collection of notes that can refer to each other --
in org-roam format. See, for instance, the one called `tax.co`.

My (Jeff Brown's) public knowledge graph:
```
https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/notes-in-org-format-on-tech
```
has notes on lots of things not specific to the Observatorio,
such as Python or AWS. The ofiscal repo sometimes refers to this one.
