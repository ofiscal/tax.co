# Introduction

tax.co is a model of the Colombian tax system.

There are README documents scattered throughout this filetree.
For instance, the [README file in the python/ folder](python/README.md)
is helpful for understanding the Python code.

To get started using the code, please see
[how to run tax.co](markdown/How-to-run-tax.co.md).
The [markdown/](markdown/) folder has more potentially helpful documentation.


# For the truly adventurous, some potentially useful information can be found is in other repos.

The Observatorio Fiscal org-roam repo:
```
https://github.com/ofiscal/knowledge-graph
```
is a knowledge graph --
a collection of notes that can refer to each other --
in org-roam format. See, for instance, the one called `tax.co`.
It is mostly TODO items, though, so probably not much use.

My (Jeff Brown's) public knowledge graph:
```
https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/notes-in-org-format-on-tech
```
has notes on lots of things not specific to the Observatorio,
such as Python or AWS. The ofiscal repo sometimes refers to this one.
Awkwardly, these notes are probably of more use to a hacker,
as they are "evergreen" -- they explain how to use the things I use here,
rather than where I'm trying to go next.
