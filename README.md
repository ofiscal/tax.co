# Introduction

tax.co is a model of the Colombian tax system.

There are README documents scattered throughout this filetree.
For instance, the [README file in the python/ folder](python/README.md)
is helpful for understanding the Python code.

To get started using the code, please see
[how to run tax.co](markdown/How-to-run-tax.co.md).
The [markdown/](markdown/) folder has more potentially helpful documentation.

# Some obsolete documentation

TODO: Update these notes to refer to [the ofiscal org-roam repo](git@github.com:ofiscal/knowledge-graph).

The truly adventurous can brave the [org/](org/) folder.
Those contain my working notes.
You probably won't need to, with a few possible exceptions:

## org-mode files of potential interest

[PITFALLS.org](org/PITFALLS.org) describes points of potential confusion --
in the data, in the code, in Python generally, and in other domains.

[TODO.org](org/TODO.org) is a list, mostly,
of things I would like to do with the codebase.

There are [two](org/enig,enph.org) org-formatted
[documents](org/enph-for-vat.org) describing the ENIG and ENPH data sets from DANE.

[tricks.org](org/tricks.org) describes methods I sometimes need to use,
like getting pandas to display tables in scientific notation.
