# PURPOSE
#########
# These functions return triples that encode how to
# determine someone's income tax as a function of their wage.
# Interpret those triples as follows:
    # First number: threshold at which a new income tax rate takes effect.
    # Second: taxable base. This is a function; you input someone's wage,
    #   and it outputs the amount of that money subject to the tax.
    # Third: average tax rate.

# PITFALL
#########
# The ENPH data gives nominal salary, before any of these contributions.

# PITFALL
#########
# Contractors pay all income taxes themselves. Employees do not --
# they pay some part of those taxes themselves,
# and their employer pays the rest.
# (In an economic sense, it all comes out of the employee's wages,
# but in a legal sense, the burden is shared with the employer.)

# CONTEXT
#########
# The model `rentas_naturales.xlsx` might make this easier to understand.
