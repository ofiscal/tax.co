# The simulation uses two measures of total income.

It uses "income", which we construct from
the 75-ish disaggregated income variables in the ENPH,
and "IT", an aggregate which DANE provides.
"income" is defined at the person level,
and therefore at the household level.
"IT" is defined only at the household level,
from which it cannot be inferred for individuals.

# "IT" is mysterious

It is not documented,
and DANE would not tell us when we asked how it is constructed.

# We prefer "IT" for certain fractions.

"IT" assigns higher incomes to the poorest households
than our "income" does.
This is because -- if I understood correctly --
DANE somehow adjusts upwards the income of households
that report extremely low income.
Our own "income" aggregate does not.
Since the ENPH was only administered for a month to a given household,
many households which do have income in a year
happened not to have any in the month they were surveyed.
Our "income" aggregate takes these reports at face value.

Because households continue to spend money even when making none,
fractions like "VAT / income" can be enormous.
"VAT / IT" can too, but not to the same extent.
Those lower ratios seem more reasonable to us,
which is why we use "IT" so much in the houshehold data.
